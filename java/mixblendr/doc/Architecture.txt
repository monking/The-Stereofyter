Class AudioOutput (setDevice,open/close)
 Class Mixer (add/remove track, setSolo)
  Class Track (volume, pan/balance, mute, getSolo, effects, owns a playlist)
   Class Playlist (list of timestamped regions and AutoObjects, ref to TimeBase)
    Class AutoObject (time)
    Class Region (extends AutoObject, ref to AudioFile, start time in AudioFile, duration, 
                  will convert samplerate and from mono to stereo)
Class Player (owns AudioOutput, AudioFileManager, Mixer, owns TimeBase, loop)
Class TimeBase (get/set current playback pos, connected to mixer for sync with audio device)
Class AudioState (global settings like number of channels and current playback position)

AudioFileFactory (manages and creates on demand audio file objects)
 AudioFile (base class for audio files)
  AudioFileURL (download from http (creating visual preview on the fly), load mp3,ogg,wav)

One common output format: 44100Hz, stereo, 16-bit

issues: 

1) when choosing a different effect, its automation data stays, 
but it's tied to its AudioEffect class, so when a new AudioEffect 
instance is created, the old automation data will not work on it.
Solutions:
- upon removing an effect, remove all automation data for it, too
- or, keep AudioEffect instances alive (practical since it will 
  stay alive anyway by the references held on its AutomationObjects)
- untie AutomationObject and AudioEffect class, communicate by way 
  of indirect references
  
2) currently, the automation data is identified by its class and
its track. That prevents multiple instances of the same effect
on one track.
